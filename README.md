# BarcodeSaver
This application allows you to save scanned barcodes in .txt. What gives you a tool for counting items by codes or just saving codes with three comments. 
Unfortunately, this application only works on android up to version 9, since on android 10 there is no direct access to the repository. In the future, 
it is necessary to rework the mechanics of accessing a file with stored codes.
